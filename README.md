🎬 Local Video Recommendation System

A smart and simple local video recommender app built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning (Cosine Similarity).
It plays videos stored inside your computer and recommends similar videos based on their tags

The Local Video Recommendation System is a Streamlit-based ML application that plays videos stored on your computer and recommends similar videos using cosine similarity.
It uses a CSV dataset containing video titles, tags, and filenames to build a simple content-based recommender model. The user selects a video to watch, the app plays the file, and then displays the top 2 similar videos based on their tags.
This project is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and demonstrates core concepts of machine learning, file handling, and UI design.
